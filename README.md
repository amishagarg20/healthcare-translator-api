# 🩺 Healthcare Translation Web App with Generative AI

## 📌 Why This App? (The Need)

Language barriers in healthcare settings can result in **misdiagnosis**, **medication errors**, and **inequitable care**. Patients who don’t speak the same language as their provider often struggle to describe symptoms or understand medical instructions — especially when it involves complex **medical terminology**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Application

This project aims to **bridge the communication gap** between patients and healthcare providers by:

- 🔊 Listening to a patient’s voice in real time  
- 🧠 Explaining complex **medical terms** clearly using Generative AI  
- 🌍 Translating the explanation into the **provider or patient’s preferred language**  
- 🎧 Playing back the explanation via audio (Text-to-Speech)

> This app is designed to be **fast, accurate, and mobile-friendly**, making it ideal for **clinics, field hospitals, or remote care settings**.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User speaks a medical term like **“Paracetamol”**
2. The app transcribes it and sends it to OpenAI's GPT
3. GPT returns an **explanation** (if it’s a medical term)
4. The explanation is then **translated** to the selected output language
5. Translated text is played back using speech synthesis
