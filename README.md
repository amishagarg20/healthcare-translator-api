🩺 Project Overview: Healthcare Translation Web App with Generative AI
📌 Why This App? (The Need)
Language barriers in healthcare settings can result in misdiagnosis, medication errors, and inequitable care. Patients who don’t speak the same language as their provider often struggle to describe symptoms or understand medical instructions — especially when it involves complex medical terminology.

🎯 Purpose of the Application
This project aims to bridge the communication gap between patients and healthcare providers by:

🔊 Listening to a patient’s voice in real time

🧠 Explaining complex medical terms clearly using Generative AI

🌍 Translating the explanation into the provider or patient’s preferred language

🎧 Playing back the explanation via audio (Text-to-Speech)

This app is designed to be fast, accurate, and mobile-friendly, making it ideal for clinics, field hospitals, or remote care settings.

🚀 What This App Does
🎤 Voice-to-Text: Users can speak medical words like "Paracetamol" or "Insulin"

🧠 Explanation: The AI explains what the term means in simple language

🌍 Translation: That explanation is translated into another language (e.g., English → Hindi)

🔊 Audio Playback: The translated explanation is spoken aloud

🎧 Replay Original Voice: Users can also replay their recorded audio
